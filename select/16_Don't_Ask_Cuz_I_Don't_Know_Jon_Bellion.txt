Yeah, see, check the bounce out
Welcome to the dope flow
Welcome to the bounce, mane
Live inside my music, so welcome to my house
Mane welcome, I'm a beat carpenter
And I'm a wordsmith
Welcome to that brand-spanking-new
You-never heard shit
Welcome to the kid that bring
A industry a new day
But some hater chefs cooking bullshit souffle
Welcome to the grindstone
Welcome to the pipe dream
Bounced up out of college 'cause I'm
Taking care of my dream
Welcome to the definition of
A frickin lab rat
With just a dream, and a dollar
And a backpack but all he cares about is
Family and good tunes
So don't ask him 'bout his next move
I haven't even picked out my socks
How could I tell you about my future
Tell you 'bout my future
How could I tell you, t-t-tell you 'bout
Please don't ask me what my next move is
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know
Yeah middle finger to the sky like this
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know
Yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know, yeah
We just don't know, we just don't know
Beautiful Mind
Welcome to the positive, negatives a no-go
Young Sensei building up his dojo
Young Boston, got the smile and the mojo
He dreams yachts while he's
Sleeping in a rowboat
Almost there, almost there, so we go-go
Go, go, stop, stop stop, stop? No, no
I'm a Wizard of the odd, Toto
Dancing with a Dorothy
Telling her to go slow
Dancing with a Dorothy
Telling her to go slow
Dancing with a Dorothy, telling her to
Telling her to

How could I tell you about my future
Tell you 'bout my future
How could I tell you, t-t-tell you 'bout
Please don't ask me what my next move is
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know
Yeah middle finger to the sky like this
'Cause I just don't know
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know
Yeah
